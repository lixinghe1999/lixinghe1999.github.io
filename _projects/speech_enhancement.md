I work on speech enhancement, which aims to improve the quality of microphone recordings. Compared to the conventional speech enhancement, I am interested on bone conduction-based speech vibration.

In my publication [vibvoice](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3581791.3596832), we propose a novel speech enhancement system that leverages the vibration on user's head (noise-free).
